What if your dashboard could predict the future?

That was the question I had in mind when I added a sales forecasting layer to this time series visualization for Mega Mart.

ðŸ“ˆ By charting order-level sales from 2019 through early 2021, I wanted to do more than just track the pastâ€”I wanted to anticipate whatâ€™s coming.

A few interesting things stood out:

Sales spiked notably in Q4 2020, with December peaking at over 10.6K.

The forecasting trend (in orange) shows a dip right at the start of 2021â€”something any business leader would want to investigate.

With the added forecast confidence interval, it's easier to plan for supply, staffing, and promotions.

This wasnâ€™t just a technical projectâ€”it was a lesson in translating raw data into strategic foresight. Forecasting isn't magic; it's just well-prepared data paired with thoughtful questions.

Have you ever used forecasting in your dashboards or reports? What tools or methods worked best for you? Iâ€™d love to hear your approach.
